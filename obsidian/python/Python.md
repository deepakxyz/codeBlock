# Object Oriented Programing
An object or[[OPP]] has two characteristics:
- attribute
- behavior
Class is a blueprint for the object.
	- Object[[OPP#Object]]
	- Method[[OPP#Methods]]
	- Inheritance[[OPP#Inheritance]]
	- encapusulation[[OPP#Data Encapsulation]]

# Function
### [[Functions#Docstrings]]
The first string after the function header is called the docstring and is short for documentaion string. It is briefly used to explain what a function does.

### [[Functions#Arbitary Arguments]]
Sometimes, we do not know in advance the number of arguments that will be passed into a function. Python allows us to handle this kind of situation through function calls with an arbitrary number of arguments.

### [[Functions#Anonymous Function]]
Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression.
